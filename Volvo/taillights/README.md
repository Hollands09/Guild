	Taillight Redesign
</h1>
<h3 align="center">
	The Plan
</h3>
<p align="center">
	The current taillights on the 240 series (I assume the same for the 740 and perhaps the 940) have a terrible floppy circuit "board" that is really awful.
	especially now that all 240s are at their youngest are 27 years old.  The current setup is a plastic bulb holder with a couple of metals tangs on it
	that are seated in the taillight assembly.  The metal tangs then make contact with the thin floppy circuit "board" which powers the lights.  There are 
	three issues I have encountered with my 240 that I wish to make a thing of the past.

>The circuit board gets worn due to vibrations and age and the connection is intermitent
>The plastic bulb holders break and no longer seat into the assembly
>The lights used are not that bright in the best of circumstances

	The planned redesign in an LED implementation that will remove many components out of the car and place it into one assembly.  With the goal of making it
	servicable, cheap and robust.
